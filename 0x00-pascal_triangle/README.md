# Pascal's triangle

<p style="font-size: medium"> Pascal's triangle is a mathematical structure shaped like a triangle filled with numbers. It has several interesting properties and applications: </p>

## Construction
It starts with a single 1 at the top. Each subsequent row is generated by adding the two numbers above it in the previous row. The numbers on the edges (far left and right) are always 1.
 
## Concepts
It uses basic arithmetic operations, specifically addition, to generate new elements.
 
## Patterns
The numbers within the triangle exhibit specific patterns. These patterns allow for calculating any element without explicitly adding all the values before it.

## Applications
Pascal's triangle has applications in various fields, including:
- Probability: It helps calculate the probability of events occurring in binomial distributions. 
- Combinatorics: It helps count the number of ways to arrange objects or select them from a set. 
- Algebra: It provides the coefficients for expanding binomial expressions.
